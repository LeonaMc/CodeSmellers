# CodeSmellers App 

Developed as part of a University project for COMP30050 Software Engineering III (University College Dublin).

The application detects poor coding practices such as primitive obsession, duplicate code and feature envy. Once a project is uploaded and the detector runs, the results are visualised and a downloadable report is generated for the end-user.
